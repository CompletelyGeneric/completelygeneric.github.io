Hey, I'm Hugh McElderry, 

this blog is where I'll be posting all my writeups and whatnot as I learn more about computer programming. I'm interested in reverse engineering and exploitation of systems almost as much as I enjoy frying skids.

My favourite languages are C and Haskell, and my dream job is to be an anti-cheat developer
