&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently quite a number of affluent players in the game Counter Strike:Global Offensive have been banned for life due to a match-fixing scandal in which "DaZed" and his team iBuyPower, purposefully lost a match in order to win thousands of dollars in ingame skins. I'm not here to discuss the morality associated with throwing a game, rather, to discuss Valve's response in this matter. 

  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To begin, there's no precedence for something like this. Match-fixing was never something that Valve have shown to care about, refusing to acknowledge or act on claims until now. I'm not upset that IBP and Dazed were punished for doing something that is objectively **wrong**, rather at Valve's harsh reaction. I understand that people are mad that they lost *money* on this game if they bet, but this also brings up a huge legal question: do the in game skins hold value?   

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Valve's official statement is "No", that they dont hold any intrinsic value, however this hasn't stopped betting sites such as [csgolounge](http://csgolounge.com/) from using them as a proxy currency for *legal* gambling; So in doing this, Valve has recognized that these skins do infact hold value, and that such a betting site *does* exist, once again, bringing us into this amorphic grey area where we dont know if this is legal or not.  

  
U.S. Code 31 ยง 5362 declares that

>the term "bet or wager" means the staking or risking by any person of something of value upon the outcome of a contest of others, a sporting event, or a game subject to chance, upon an agreement or understanding that the person or another person will receive something of value in the event of a certain outcome;  
   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's clear that one can see what csgolounge is doing as gambling, and only time will tell if the government wants to get involved in this.   
    



[Ending on a comical note](https://twitter.com/SirScoots/status/564083952017604608), here's SirScoot's reaction to all of this.
