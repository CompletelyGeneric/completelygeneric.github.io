After my initial disappointment in pramiracetam, and my aversion to taking traditional ADHD medications such as vyvanse or adderall on a daily basis, I turned to a friend who had recently been experimenting with the relatively newer drug semax and one of its variants, N-acetyl semax. For those of you who don't know, semax is a drug that is currently prescribed in Russia for quite a wide range of conditions, but most commonly as a cognitive enhancer.



Before I talk about the effectiveness of the drug, I feel its needed to list some information about me, and what I expected of the drug. I'm an 18 year old male with depression and anxiety, looking for a drug to serve as a cognitive enhancer to replace my current dependence on vyvanse for studying, working, and any other activity in which I would otherwise lack the motivation to complete. With that out of the way, we can begin with a dissection of the effectiveness of the drug. 



I ordered my NA-semax from [Ceretropic](http://www.ceretropic.com/n-acetyl-semax-spray/) who currently is the only supplier of it as far as I know at the time of writing. Upon receiving my shipment of NA-Semax, I immediately refrigerated it for 6 hours and then took my first dose of 300mcg. Within 15 minutes of dosing I began to notice a subtle improvement in mood, and then proceeded to set to work for the night. I found that for the first night it was a perfect replacement for my regular dose of 40mgs of vyvanse. Surprisingly, this wasn't simply a honeymoon period, as the drug actually improved with effectiveness with daily dosing. Once I was happy with the dose I was at, I began to experiment with dosages to see how far I could push the drug. The effects of 300mcg to 600mcg are largely the same in my experiences, but at 900mcgs I began to start feeling quite anxious and over-focused. I continued to take 900mcgs for 2 days after the initial dose of it, however the effects never improved, and I reverted to my old Goldilocks dose of 300mcg. I also have yet to experience a negative "crash" that has been common with every other ADHD medication that I have tried.



Summarily, I would highly recommend this drug to anyone who doesn't want to experience the negative effects of stimulant type ADHD medications.
