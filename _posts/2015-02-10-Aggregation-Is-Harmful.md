title: "Aggregation Is Harmful"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fairly recently I've discovered the existence of [lobste.rs](http://lobste.rs) and have taken to browsing it quite frequently, so I wont attempt to absolve myself of relying on some type of aggregator. However, I can't help but be bothered by the very nature of them.   
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first issue I take with sites that attempt to collectivize information is that they rarely deviate from a point system in which users give points to posts they like, raising them towards the top of the page, or from one which implements the converse as well. Quickly a page turns from a news site into a news community, developing culture that influences what appears at the top of the page, which isn't intrinsically bad, however it quickly snowballs into posts made just for the sake of gaining these points, leading to posts void of real content. I hate to be clich√©, however the primary example that   presents itself is Reddit.  
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We're very quickly moving towards systems in which content is built around the community, instead of the community being built around the content. And most alarming is that ostensibly these aren't the intentions of the sites, merely a byproduct of the nature of aggregation. This hive mind is at the core of why collectivization is harmful. 

zzz thats really the only rant that I have for today on the subject
